- [x] Basic sync results display
- [x] Manual sync trigger
- [x] API status indicator
- [x] Nginx configuration

## Phase 2: Authentication & Data Integration

- [ ] Supabase authentication integration
- [ ] User login/logout functionality
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Persistent storage of sync results
- [ ] Integration with actual API endpoints
- [ ] Storage of historical sync data

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

- [ ] Detailed sync logs and history
- [ ] Error tracking and notifications
- [ ] Email alerts for failed syncs
- [ ] Sync schedule management
- [ ] Custom sync date range selection
- [ ] Filtering and searching sync results

## Phase 4: Administration

- [ ] User role management (admin, viewer)
- [ ] System configuration UI
- [ ] Advanced reporting
- [ ] Dashboard customization
- [ ] Performance metrics

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. Implement Supabase auth
2. Add login/signup pages
3. Create protected routes
4. Connect auth to API requests
5. Store user session

### Data Layer

1. Create Supabase tables:
   - sync_results: Store results of each sync operation
   - sync_logs: Detailed logs of each sync
   - users: User information and permissions
   - settings: System configuration

2. Data synchronization:
   - Sync results from API to Supabase
   - Store historical data
   - Calculate statistics

### UI Components

1. Authentication:
   - Login/Signup form
   - Password reset
   - User profile

2. Dashboard:
   - Summary statistics
   - Recent syncs
   - Error indicators

3. Reporting:
   - Data visualization
   - Historical trends
   - Export functionality

### API Integration

1. Full integration with all API endpoints:
   - `/api.v1/sync/initiate`
   - `/api.v1/status`
   - `/api.v1/4demr/*`
   - `/api.v1/qbo/*`

2. API error handling:
   - Retry mechanisms
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Logging

## Deployment Strategy

1. Development Environment:
   - Local Vite server
   - Mock API responses

2. Staging Environment:
   - Deploy to staging server
   - Connect to test API endpoints
   - Test with production-like data

3. Production Environment:
   - Deploy to production server
   - Secure with HTTPS
   - Monitor performance
   - Setup backups
